      <technologyDescriptionAndIncludedProcesses xml:lang="en">Foreground system:
Styrene Acrylonitrile (SAN) and Alpha-Methyl Styrene Acrylonitrile (AMSAN) are most commonly made using a bulk polymerisation process. The process consists of continuous feeds of the monomers as well as possibly initiators chain transfer agents and solvent, to one or more polymerisation reactors. Polymerisation takes place between 80 and 170°C; adequate agitation is critical for proper tempera-ture and composition control. The product then goes to devolatilisation units and pelletiser. Unreacted monomers are recycled to maintain conversion and composition at desired levels. 

For SAN/AMSAN sold to the market, additives such as lubricants, antioxidants or light stabilisers can also be added.


Background system:
Electricity: Electricity is modelled according to the individual country-specific situations. The country-specific modelling is achieved on multiple levels. Firstly, individual energy carrier specific power plants and plants for renewable energy sources are modelled according to the current national electricity grid mix. Modelling the electricity consumption mix includes transmission / distribution losses and the own use by energy producers (own consumption of power plants and "other" own consumption e.g. due to pumped storage hydro power etc.), as well as imported electricity. Secondly, the national emission and efficiency standards of the power plants are modelled as well as the share of electricity plants and combined heat and power plants (CHP). Thirdly, the country-specific energy carrier supply (share of imports and / or domestic supply) including the country-specific energy carrier properties (e.g. element and energy content) are accounted for. Fourthly, the exploration, mining/production, processing and transport processes of the energy carrier supply chains are modelled according to the specific situation of each electricity producing country. The different production and processing techniques (emissions and efficiencies) in the different energy producing countries are considered, e.g. different crude oil production technologies or different flaring rates at the oil platforms.
Thermal energy, process steam: The thermal energy and process steam supply is modelled according to the individual country-specific situation with regard to emission standards and considered energy carriers. The thermal energy and process steam are produced at heat plants. Efficiencies for thermal energy production are by definition 100% in relation to the corresponding energy carrier input. For process steam the efficiency ranges from 85%, 90% to 95%. The energy carriers used for the generation of thermal energy and process steam are modelled according to the specific import situation (see electricity above).
Transports: All relevant and known transport processes are included. Ocean-going and inland ship transport as well as rail, truck and pipeline transport of bulk commodities are considered.
Energy carriers: The energy carriers are modelled according to the specific supply situation (see electricity above).
Refinery products: Diesel fuel, gasoline, technical gases, fuel oils, lubricants and residues such as bitumen are modelled with a parameterised country-specific refinery model. The refinery model represents the current national standard in refining techniques (e.g. emission level, internal energy consumption, etc.) as well as the individual country-specific product output spectrum, which can be quite different from country to country. The supply of crude oil is modelled, again, according to the country-specific situation with the respective properties of the resources.</technologyDescriptionAndIncludedProcesses>

In some companies information, output material with deviations from the required specification is re-ported. If these materials show only slight differences and are sold at comparable price-level, they are assumed as product output (&lt; 4% of total production); in case of material declared as off-grade sent to recovery, neither further environmental burden nor credits are given to the modelled system (&lt; 1% of total production).
No post-consumer waste is reported as input to the system, therefore no allocation between different life cycles is necessary.

Background system:
In the refinery operations, co-production is addressed by applying allocation based on mass and net calorific value. The chosen allocation in downstream petrochemicals is based on several sensitivity analyses, which were reviewed by petrochemical experts.  Materials and chemicals needed are modelled using the allocation rule most suitable for the respective product (mass, energy, exergy, economic).

In single cases additives used in the SAN/AMSAN foreground unit process (&lt;0.3% m/m of product output) are neglected. In such cases, it is assured that no hazardous sub-stances or metals are present in this neglected part. According to the GaBi database used in the background processes, at least 95% of mass and energy of the input and output flows are covered and 98% of their environmental relevance (according to expert judgment) are considered, hence an influence of cut-offs less than 1% on the total is expected. Transports for the main input materials (styrene, alpha-methyl styrene, acrylonitrile) contribute less than 3% to the overall environmental burden. The contribution of transport of small material proportions is expected to be less than 1%; hence the transports for minor input amounts are excluded.</dataCutOffAndCompletenessPrinciples>

        <common:reviewDetails xml:lang="en">As part of the PlasticsEurope programme management and quality assurance, DEKRA Consulting GmbH conducted an external independent critical review of this work. The outcome of the critical review is reproduced below.


The subject of this critical review is the development of the Eco-profile for Styrene Acrylonitrile (SAN) and Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS).

The review process included various meetings/web-conferences between the LCA practitioner and the reviewer, which encompassed a model and database review and spot checks of data and calcula-tions. Furthermore, the final Eco-profile report was reviewed by the reviewer as well as industry partic-ipants involved in this project. All questions and recommendations were discussed with the LCA prac-titioner, and the report was adapted and revised accordingly.

Primary industry data were collected for the foreground processes comprising the production of SAN and ABS and taking into account the specific production processes of the four participating companies. Background data representing the main precursors as well as all other material and energy inputs were taken from the GaBi database. Primary industry data was collected from 5 sites producing SAN (one of which producing SAN from Alpha Methyl Styrene (AMS)) and five sites producing ABS, which lead to an estimated overall representativeness of &gt;90% of the installed European SAN and ABS production capacity.

        <common:reviewDetails xml:lang="en">All data sets in the GaBi Databases are constantly used, compared, benchmarked and reviewed by a broad GaBi user community. Calculated results are published frequently in various external, professional and third party LCA literature, papers, and other media within industry, academia and politics. The incorporation of feedback provided by the GaBi users is standard practice in the maintenance and update procedure, and leads to stable, quality-assured and constantly improved data.  The internal review is done with several iterative steps involving raw data validation, raw data documentation, representativeness, completeness and consistent modelling with regard to ISO 14040 and 14044. The data set documentation is correct in respect to the appropriateness of the information available. It includes all relevant information in relation to data quality and the scope of application of the respective LCI result.</common:reviewDetails>

      <common:intendedApplications xml:lang="en">This background LCI data set can be used for any types of LCA studies. LCA studies considering the full life cycle (»cradle-to-grave«) of an application or product allow for comparative assertions to be derived. It is essential to note that comparisons cannot be made at the level of the polymer or its precursors. In order to compare the performance of different materials, the whole life cycle and the effects of relevant life cycle parameters must be considered. It is intended to be used by member companies, to support product-orientated environmental management; by users of plastics, as a building block of life cycle assessment (LCA) studies of individual products; and by other interested parties, as a source of life cycle information.</common:intendedApplications>
