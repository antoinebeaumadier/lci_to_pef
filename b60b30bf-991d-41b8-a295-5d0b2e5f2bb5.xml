Expandable Polystyrene (EPS) is produced by polymerisation of styrene monomer, a chain-growth reaction which is mostly initiated by free radical organic initiators. EPS beads are produced by suspension polymerisation, extrusion or mass pelletisation.

Expandable Polystyrene (EPS) is most commonly made using a suspension polymerisation process. Styrene charged with organic peroxide initiators is added to an aqueous phase and forms a suspen-sion upon stirring. Flame retardant and elemental carbon, as well as auxiliaries such as suspension stabilisers, chain transfer agents, expanding aids, nucleating agents and plasticisers can also be added. 
The styrene droplets polymerise to polystyrene during heating of the reactor between 80 and 150°C. Blowing agent, typically pentane, is added to the reactor during polymerisation and dissolves in the polymer, producing the Expandable Polystyrene bead.
After the reactor is cooled, the polymer is separated from the water phase using a centrifuge. The EPS beads are dried and sieved into the required size fractions before being coated with additive, which aids the conversion process and final foam properties.

The EPS beads may also be produced by applying the extrusion route. The polymerisation step takes place in a styrene melt in the extruder. Additives and pentane are added in a static mixer; the final product is formed to beads in a pelletisation equipment. A variation of this type of technology is called mass pelletisation: polystyrene from suspension polymerisation is re-melted in an extrusion process, further auxiliaries are added; the beads are produced with special pelletisation nozzles.


Background system:
Electricity: Electricity is modelled according to the individual country-specific situations. The country-specific modelling is achieved on multiple levels. Firstly, individual energy carrier specific power plants and plants for renewable energy sources are modelled according to the current national electricity grid mix. Modelling the electricity consumption mix includes transmission / distribution losses and the own use by energy producers (own consumption of power plants and "other" own consumption e.g. due to pumped storage hydro power etc.), as well as imported electricity. Secondly, the national emission and efficiency standards of the power plants are modelled as well as the share of electricity plants and combined heat and power plants (CHP). Thirdly, the country-specific energy carrier supply (share of imports and / or domestic supply) including the country-specific energy carrier properties (e.g. element and energy content) are accounted for. Fourthly, the exploration, mining/production, processing and transport processes of the energy carrier supply chains are modelled according to the specific situation of each electricity producing country. The different production and processing techniques (emissions and efficiencies) in the different energy producing countries are considered, e.g. different crude oil production technologies or different flaring rates at the oil platforms.
Thermal energy, process steam: The thermal energy and process steam supply is modelled according to the individual country-specific situation with regard to emission standards and considered energy carriers. The thermal energy and process steam are produced at heat plants. Efficiencies for thermal energy production are by definition 100% in relation to the corresponding energy carrier input. For process steam the efficiency ranges from 85%, 90% to 95%. The energy carriers used for the generation of thermal energy and process steam are modelled according to the specific import situation (see electricity above).
Transports: All relevant and known transport processes are included. Ocean-going and inland ship transport as well as rail, truck and pipeline transport of bulk commodities are considered.
Energy carriers: The energy carriers are modelled according to the specific supply situation (see electricity above).
Refinery products: Diesel fuel, gasoline, technical gases, fuel oils, lubricants and residues such as bitumen are modelled with a parameterised country-specific refinery model. The refinery model represents the current national standard in refining techniques (e.g. emission level, internal energy consumption, etc.) as well as the individual country-specific product output spectrum, which can be quite different from country to country. The supply of crude oil is modelled, again, according to the country-specific situation with the respective properties of the resources.</technologyDescriptionAndIncludedProcesses>

In some companies information, output material with deviations from the required specification is re-ported. If these materials show only slight differences and are sold at comparable price-level, they are assumed as product output (&lt; 2% of total production); in case of material declared as off-grade sent to recovery, neither further environmental burden nor credits are given to the modelled system (&lt; 2% of total production).
No post-consumer waste is reported as input to the system, therefore no allocation between different life cycles is necessary.

Background system:
In the refinery operations, co-production is addressed by applying allocation based on mass and net calorific value. The chosen allocation in downstream petrochemicals is based on several sensitivity analyses, which were reviewed by petrochemical experts.  Materials and chemicals needed are modelled using the allocation rule most suitable for the respective product (mass, energy, exergy, economic).

In such cases, it is assured that no hazardous substances or metals are present in this neglected part. According to the GaBi database 2013, used in the background processes, at least 95% of mass and energy of the input and output flows are covered and 98% of their environmental relevance (according to expert judgment) are considered, hence an influence of cut-offs less than 1% on the total is expected. Transports for the main input materials (styrene) con-tribute less than 5% to the overall environmental burden. The contribution of transport of small material proportions is expected to be less than 1%; hence the transports for minor input amounts are excluded.</dataCutOffAndCompletenessPrinciples>

        <common:reviewDetails xml:lang="en">As part of the PlasticsEurope programme management and quality assurance, DEKRA Consulting GmbH conducted an external independent critical review of this work. The outcome of the critical review is reproduced below.

The subject of this critical review is the development of the Eco-profile for Expandable Polystyrene (EPS) including white and grey material.

The review process included various meetings/web-conferences between the LCA practitioner and the reviewer, which encompassed a model and database review and spot checks of data and calcula-tions. Furthermore, the final Eco-profile report was reviewed by the reviewer as well as industry partic-ipants involved in this project. All questions and recommendations were discussed with the LCA prac-titioner, and the report was adapted and revised accordingly.

Primary industry data were collected for the foreground processes comprising the production of white and grey EPS and taking into account the specific production processes of the participating compa-nies. Background data representing the main precursor, i.e. styrene as well as all other material and energy inputs were taken from the GaBi database. Primary industry data was collected from 10 white EPS producers with 13 plants in 9 different European countries and 4 grey EPS producers with 4 plants in 4 different European countries, which lead to an estimated overall representativeness of &gt;80% of the installed European EPS production capacity. 

The potential environmental impacts for EPS are dominated (&gt;80%) by the precursor product styrene across all impact categories. Electricity and thermal energy needed for EPS production also have a significant impact (about 6% for GWP). The results for ADP elements are also influenced by the use of deionised water which requires salt and other additives. 

The Eco-profile report also includes a comparison of the results with the previous version of the EPS Eco-profile. However, due to reasons outlined in the main report, a detailed analysis of the reasons for the differences is difficult and should be treated with great caution. 

The LCA practitioners have demonstrated very good competence and experience, with a track record of LCA projects in the chemical and plastics industry. The critical review confirms that this Eco-profile adheres to the rules set forth in the PlasticsEuropes Eco-profiles and Environmental Declarations  LCI Methodology and PCR for Uncompounded Polymer Resins and Reactive Polymer Precursors (PCR version 2.0, April 2011). As a result, this dataset is assessed to be a reliable and high quality representation of EPS produced in Europe.

        <common:reviewDetails xml:lang="en">All data sets in the GaBi Databases are constantly used, compared, benchmarked and reviewed by a broad GaBi user community. Calculated results are published frequently in various external, professional and third party LCA literature, papers, and other media within industry, academia and politics. The incorporation of feedback provided by the GaBi users is standard practice in the maintenance and update procedure, and leads to stable, quality-assured and constantly improved data.  The internal review is done with several iterative steps involving raw data validation, raw data documentation, representativeness, completeness and consistent modelling with regard to ISO 14040 and 14044. The data set documentation is correct in respect to the appropriateness of the information available. It includes all relevant information in relation to data quality and the scope of application of the respective LCI result.</common:reviewDetails>

      <common:intendedApplications xml:lang="en">This background LCI data set can be used for any types of LCA studies. LCA studies considering the full life cycle (»cradle-to-grave«) of an application or product allow for comparative assertions to be derived. It is essential to note that comparisons cannot be made at the level of the polymer or its precursors. In order to compare the performance of different materials, the whole life cycle and the effects of relevant life cycle parameters must be considered. It is intended to be used by member companies, to support product-orientated environmental management; by users of plastics, as a building block of life cycle assessment (LCA) studies of individual products; and by other interested parties, as a source of life cycle information.</common:intendedApplications>
